# Feature Engineering Techniques and Examples

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a practical guide and collection of code examples for various **Feature Engineering** techniques. Feature engineering is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline, focusing on transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, ultimately leading to improved model performance.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how to:
*   Create new features from existing ones.
*   Transform features to meet model assumptions or improve distribution.
*   Handle different data types (numerical, categorical, datetime, text).
*   Select the most relevant features for a given task.

## Key Areas Covered / Techniques Demonstrated

This project explores and implements techniques across several categories of feature engineering:

### 1. Handling Numerical Features
*   **Transformations:** Log transformation, square root, power transforms (e.g., Yeo-Johnson, Box-Cox).
*   **Discretization/Binning:** Converting continuous features into categorical bins.
*   **Interaction Features:** Creating new features by multiplying or dividing existing numerical features.
*   **Polynomial Features:** Generating polynomial combinations of features.

### 2. Handling Categorical Features
*   **Encoding:** One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, Target Encoding.
*   **Feature Hashing:** For high-cardinality categorical variables.
*   **Frequency Encoding:** Encoding based on the frequency of categories.

### 3. Handling Datetime Features
*   Extracting components: Year, Month, Day, Weekday, Hour, Minute.
*   Calculating time differences (e.g., 'days since last event').
*   Creating cyclical features (e.g., sine/cosine transformations for month/day).

### 4. Handling Text Features (if applicable)
*   Bag-of-Words (BoW)
*   TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
*   Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe - if deep learning is involved)

### 5. Feature Scaling
*   Standardization (`StandardScaler`)
*   Normalization (`MinMaxScaler`)

### 6. Feature Selection (if applicable)
*   Filter Methods (e.g., correlation, chi-squared)
*   Wrapper Methods (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination - RFE)
*   Embedded Methods (e.g., L1 regularization)
